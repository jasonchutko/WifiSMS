I code a lot from my desktop, so I wrote this so my boss wont know I'm texting on the job :P

Using the app is pretty simple.. 
Just activate via SBSettings, then Navigate to your iphone's IP address.

e.g. http://192.168.1.2:8080/

or via bonjour like http://treasons-iphone.local:8080/ (of course rename the "treason" part with your iDevice name)

Port is configurable through the web interface.
Authentication can be added through the web interface.
You can send and receive SMS, and view MMS (pics and videos)

Umm I'm sure there's some other stuff I am forgetting to mention but yea install it and poke around.
